A game website that easily scales, including multiplayer support.

## Setup for dev:
- ensure go and npm are installed
- navigate into the frontend folder and make the script executable
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run all` to run
- open the link that it gives you to see the site
- edits to the frontend will be made live
- edits to the backend will be made upon restarting the server
